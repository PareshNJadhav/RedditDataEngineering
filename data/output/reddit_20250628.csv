1llt6y9,"Do you use CDC? If yes, how does it benefit you?",57,81,wtfzambo,"I am dealing with a data pipeline that uses CDC on pretty much all DB tables.
The changes are written to object storage, and daily merged to a Delta table using SCD2 strategy. One Delta for each DB table.

After working with this for a few months, I have concluded that, most likely, the project would be better off if we just switched to daily full snapshots, getting rid of both CDC and SCD2.

Which then led me to the above question in the title: did you ever find yourself in a situation were CDC was the optimal solution? If so, can you elaborate? How was CDC data modeled afterwards?

1llvqzs,Would you take a $27K pay cut to land your first DE role?,16,57,Miserable-Toe5090,"Hey everyone—I could really use some advice.

I’m currently a senior data analyst working in healthcare fraud analytics and model development at a large government contracting firm. Our client has multiple contracts with us, and I support one of them. I’ve been interested in moving into data engineering for a while and am about halfway through a master’s in computer and information technology.

Recently, I asked if I could shadow the DE team on an adjacent contract, and they brought me in for their latest sprint. Shortly after, the program manager on that team asked if I’d be interested in applying for an open DE role. I was thrilled—it felt like the perfect opportunity.

I already know the data really well (I worked on their recent migration efforts and use their tables regularly), and I’m familiar with some of the team. It’s a solid internal move with a lot of alignment.

The catch? I’d have to take a $27K pay cut—from $137K to $110K.
I expected a cut since I don’t have formal DE experience and would be stepping into a mid-level role, but that number feels steep—especially since I live in a high cost of living area and recently bought a house.

⸻

My question for you all:
1. Would you take the job anyway, just to get your foot in the door?
2. Has anyone else here made a similar internal switch from analyst to DE? How did it work out long-term?
3. Are there ways to negotiate this kind of internal transition to ease the pay gap? (e.g. retention bonus, hybrid role, defined promotion path)
4. If I pass this up, how hard would it be to break into DE externally without prior experience or the DE title?

Any perspective—especially from folks who’ve made the jump or hired junior/mid DEs—would really help. Thanks in advance!",2025-06-27 14:47:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1llvqzs/would_you_take_a_27k_pay_cut_to_land_your_first/,False,False,False,False

Something like DuckDB with their spatial extension would work, but do people have any other suggestions?

An illustrative use case is this: the db stores the location of every house in a country along with a few attribute like household income and number of occupants. (Don't worry that's not actually what I'm storing, but it's comparable in scope). A typical query is to get the total occupants within a quarter mile of every house in a certain state. So I can say that 123 Main Street has 100 people living nearby....repeated for 100,000 other addresses.

1llrd1d,Where do you store static element you need to?,6,5,Commercial_Dig2401,"I was wondering where do you usually store static element that are often require to ingest or to filter in your different pipeline.

Currently we use DBT seeds, for most of them, this remove static elements from our SQL files but CSV seeds are often not enough to represent the static element I require.

For example, one of my third party vendors have an endpoint which return a bunch of data in a lot of different format, I would like to track a list of the format I’ve approved, validated, etc.
The different type of data are generally handle by 2 elements. I would like to avoid having to define element1, subelement1, approved, format_x

element1, subelement2, approved, format_y.

I currently can do this in seeds but what I would like is a kind of CRM that allow me to do relations. So if element1 is approve than that’s something, and I have somewhere else to store all approved subelement for this.

Might be complicate to understand in simple words, but tldr how do you store static things that are required for your pipeline ? I want something else than juste a table in Postgres because I want non tech people to be able to add elements

We currently use Salesforce for some stuff, but are going away from it so I try to find a simple solution which can work for DE and not necessary the company as a hole. Something simple nothing fancy is required.

Just now, I found that conda-forge carries PySpark.  I wonder how long it has been available, and hence, whether I could have avoided the ordeals in getting PySpark working (and not very well, at that).

Looking back at the files [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyspark/files), it seems that it started 8 years ago, which is much longer than I've been using Python, and much, much longer than my stints into PySpark.

1lllraf,I built a multimodal document workflow system using VLMs - processes complex docs end-to-end,1,1,yes-no-maybe_idk,"Hey r/dataengineering 

We're building Morphik: a multimodal search layer for AI applications that works super well with complex documents.

Our users kept using our search API in creative ways to build document workflows and we realized they needed proper workflow automation, not just search queries.

So we built workflow automation for documents. Extract data, save to metadata, add custom logic: all automated. Uses vision language models for accuracy.

We use it for our invoicing workflow - automatically processes vendor invoices, extracts key data, flags issues, saves everything searchable.

Works for any document type where you need automated processing + searchability. (an example of it working for safety data sheets below)

We'll be adding remote API calls soon so you can trigger notifications, approvals, etc.

Try it out: [https://morphik.ai](https://morphik.ai)

1lme7zn,What to learn first ? stuck on lots of different technologies,0,3,erickedrm,"Hi, just overwhelmed with all the stack to become a DE (or similar role), and land an entry job.

I have a background in tech, also have a CS degree ( Mexico btw, not sure if it helps a lot)

I do know Python (basic and POO stuff) also Java and Angular (main stack) ,but currently im working with SIEBEL( Oracle CRM) and i think im getting stuck in this tech and i want a change, i think it helps that i use a lot of SQL (not for big data)

I know the very basics of Python for analysis 

I took a course for PowerBi (not sure if needed but hope it does)and im thinkin to learn spark next, but theres a lot of things that im missing, such a data warehouses or cloud.

But i think im a bit lost about the ""path"" i should follow , i know its hard  to start as a DE or similar but i want to be as prepared as i can be for future interviews.

So any tips are welcomed, tips for interviews aswell
